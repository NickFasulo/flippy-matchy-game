# Flippy Matchy
Play here: ---

Flippy matchy is a match card game. To win you need to match each pair of identical cards in a deck. There are three levels to choose from: Easy, Medium, and Hard. The difference in levels are the amount of cards that are on the board. 

Once a level is started, there is a brief moment where all of the cards are revealed - try to remember where the pairs are placed! 

There is also a "Tries" counter that keep track of the amount of failed attempts at matching two cards - try to keep this number as low as possible!
